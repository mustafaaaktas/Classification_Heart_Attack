**Heart Attack Classification Project**

Overview

This project focuses on developing machine learning models to classify heart attack risk based on medical data. Using various supervised learning algorithms, the system predicts whether a patient is at risk (positive) or not (negative) for a heart attack based on critical features extracted from the dataset.

Project Objectives

	•	To preprocess and analyze the dataset for patterns and insights.
	•	To implement and evaluate multiple machine learning models.
	•	To identify the best-performing model for heart attack classification.
	•	To visualize the data and model results for better interpretability.

Dataset

The dataset, heart_attack.csv, includes key medical indicators such as age, gender, glucose levels, troponin, blood pressure, and others. The target variable (class) indicates the heart attack risk (positive or negative).

Data Summary

	•	Total Samples: 1310
	•	Features: 8
	•	Target: class (binary classification: positive/negative)

_Methodology_

1. Data Preprocessing

The data_processing.py script handles:
* Loading the dataset (heart_attack.csv) into a Pandas DataFrame.
* Filtering rows where the troponin value is less than 10, as values equal to or greater than 10 are considered outliers due to insufficient sample sizes and being a potential outlier.
* Normalization and feature scaling.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis

The troponin_eda.py script visualizes relationships and distributions in the dataset, focusing on troponin, glucose, and other features.

3. Model Training

Four models were implemented and fine-tuned using GridSearchCV for hyperparameter optimization:
* Decision Tree Classifier: (decision_tree_classifier.py)
* Random Forest Classifier: (random_forest_classifier.py)
* K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): (k_neighbors_classifier.py)
* Support Vector Machine (SVM): (support_vector_machine.py)

4. Visualization

The visuals.py script provides visual comparisons of model performances and key insights into the dataset.

**Results**

| Algorithm               | Accuracy |
|-------------------------|----------|
| Decision Tree           | 0.989    |
| Random Forest           | 0.985    |
| K-Nearest Neighbors     | 0.698    |
| Support Vector Machine  | 0.912    |

Best Performing Model: Decision Tree Classifier

Best Parameters:
* 	Criterion: gini
* 	Max Depth: None
* 	Min Samples Leaf: 2
* 	Min Samples Split: 10 

Classification Report:
* 	Precision: 0.97–1.00
* 	Recall: 0.98–1.00
* 	F1-Score: 0.98–0.99

Key Findings

*   Decision Tree and Random Forest achieved the highest accuracy.
* 	SVM showed robust performance with optimized hyperparameters.
* 	KNN had lower accuracy due to sensitivity to class imbalance and feature scaling.

Conclusion

This project successfully classified heart attack risks using various machine learning models. The Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine models achieved high accuracy, with the Decision Tree performing the best at 98.9%. These models excelled due to their ability to handle non-linear relationships and focus on critical features like Troponin.

Troponin, a key biomarker for heart damage, played a significant role in accurate predictions. Its variations directly correlate with heart attack risks, making it the most influential feature in the dataset.
